Note: By default when we try to expose pod or deployment to a specific port, kubernetes will handle that by using ClusterIp.
To access the application in the pod we use port forwarding; 

$ kubectl port-forward pods/<name> 9000

We can as well port forward to a service:

$ kubectl port-forward services/<name> 8000

The limitation here is you can not access the application from outside the cluster server!!!

If we need to access the application from outside the cluster we use;

1- Node port
2- Loadbalancer
